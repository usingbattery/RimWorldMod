add two new guns to RimWorld, they are designed for hunting at early period.

they are based on BoltActionRifle(栓动步枪) and PumpShotGun(泵动霰弹枪), modified as follows:
1. 100% shooting accuracy at max range; less shooting accuracy at other range as a balance;\
   -to increase hunting efficiency; keep balance of full range accuracy;
2. about 1.5 times longer time between two shooting and 1.5 times greater damage at one shoot; time between = cooldownTime + warmupTime;\
   -to injure animals more severer and keep balance of dps;
3. zero warmupTime, all time between two shooting goes to cooldownTime;\
   -to increase hunting efficiency GREATLY! for it avoids target move out of range at warming up;
4. 0% armor penetration as a balance;
5. more range for BoltActionHuntingGun; less range for PumpHuntingGun;\
   -longer range makes more security; less range limits it to hunting animals don't revenge;

if enemies are equipped with these hunting gun, stay out of their range! they have 1.5*damage per shoot and zero warmupTime! it's too dangerous!\
if BoltActionHuntingGun, coming to melee is the only way to guaranteed safety;\
else if PumpHuntingGun, just keep a safe distance with it;
